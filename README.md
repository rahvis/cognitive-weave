# Cognitive Weave

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper:

**Cognitive Weave: Synthesizing Abstracted Knowledge with a Spatio-Temporal Resonance Graph**

Cognitive Weave implements LLM-driven synthesis of new, structured insights (Insight Aggregates) from enriched information units (Insight Particles), aiming for a more dynamic and emergent understanding within the agent's memory.

## Project Overview

Cognitive Weave introduces a novel approach to information processing and memory management in AI systems. The core components include:

1. **Insight Particles (IPs)**: Fundamental units of knowledge that include:
   - Resonance keys (core identifying terms)
   - Signifiers (broader categorical labels)
   - Situational imprint (concise contextual summary)
   - Extracted entities

2. **Insight Aggregates (IAs)**: Higher-level synthesized knowledge created from related IPs
3. **Semantic Oracle Interface (SOI)**: LLM-powered interface for deep semantic understanding
4. **Spatio-Temporal Resonance Graph (STRG)**: Hybrid data structure for multi-faceted recall
