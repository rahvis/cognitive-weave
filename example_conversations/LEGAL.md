This dialogue is designed to test the Cognitive Weave agent's ability to:

Create and store distinct InsightParticles (IPs) for each piece of information.
Retrieve relevant IPs when the user asks related questions.
Synthesize InsightAggregates (IAs) from multiple IPs.
Utilize both IPs and IAs to provide contextually informed responses.
You can copy and paste these user inputs one by one into the conversational_agent.py script when it prompts "You: ".

Complex Divorce Law Conversation Example:

Turn 1
You: I need some guidance. My spouse and I are considering a divorce. We've been married for 15 years and have two children, aged 10 and 13. It's all very overwhelming.

Turn 2
You: We own a house together with a significant mortgage, have some joint investment accounts, and about five years ago, we started a small online retail business that has become quite profitable. I'm worried about how all that will be divided.

Turn 3
You: Before we got married, we did sign a prenuptial agreement. I'm not even sure what it says anymore, but my spouse's family had insisted on it. Also, I'm thinking about moving to another state after this is all over to be closer to my family for support, and I'd want the children to come with me.

(At this point, after 3 turns, the agent should attempt IA synthesis. The log should show this process.)

Turn 4
You: Can you explain the general process for determining child custody in a divorce? And how might that prenuptial agreement impact the division of our assets, especially the business we built together during the marriage?

Turn 5
You: This whole situation is causing me a lot of emotional distress and anxiety. I've had trouble sleeping and focusing at work. Is the emotional impact on a spouse considered in divorce proceedings, perhaps in relation to spousal support or even custody decisions?

Turn 6
You: Considering everything we've discussed – the children, the house, investments, our joint business, the prenup, my potential relocation, and the emotional toll – what are the top three legal areas I should be most concerned about right now? And what specific type of divorce lawyer should I be looking for given these complexities?

(At this point, after 6 turns, the agent should attempt IA synthesis again. The log should show this, potentially creating a more refined IA or a new one based on all accumulated information.)

Why this conversation is designed to be effective for demonstration:

Layered Complexity: It introduces multiple legal facets (children, property, business, prenup, relocation, emotional factors) gradually.
Interconnected Issues: The user's concerns are often linked (e.g., prenup affecting business division, relocation impacting custody).
Memory Recall Prompts: Questions like in Turn 4 and Turn 6 explicitly ask the agent to consider previously discussed information.
IA Synthesis Opportunities: The accumulation of distinct but related issues provides rich ground for the SemanticOracleInterface to synthesize meaningful InsightAggregates. For example:
After Turn 3, an IA might summarize: "User is navigating a divorce involving children, shared assets including a business, a prenuptial agreement, and a desire to relocate with children."
After Turn 6, a more comprehensive IA might emerge or the previous one might be refined.
Demonstrating RAG: When the agent answers in Turn 4 or Turn 6, the logs should show it retrieving relevant IPs and potentially the IA to include in the "Available Memories" section of the prompt sent to the conversational LLM. This demonstrates Retrieval Augmented Generation.
Testing Retrieval Relevance: The agent's ability to pick out the most relevant IPs (e.g., the prenup IP when asked about asset division, the children IP when asked about custody) will be tested.
Realistic User Journey: The flow mimics how a person might gradually reveal details and concerns when seeking initial legal information.
When you run this, pay close attention to the console logs. You should see:

Each user input being processed into an IP.
The retrieve_relevant_insights function being called and (hopefully) finding relevant IPs.
The _attempt_ia_synthesis function being called and (hopefully) creating IAs.
The "Available Memories" in the LLM prompt reflecting what the agent has recalled or synthesized.
This should give you a good demonstration of the agentic memory capabilities you've built.
